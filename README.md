#Hi!#

  If youve gotten this far into evaluating me for Hacker school (I assume that's what you're here for) yoou should know a few things about me!

  My name is Dhasharath Shrivathsa, a 16 year own born and brought up in Silicon valley.
I built my first computer when I was 11 years old, and that basic fram has lasted me through the years and is one of my main comuters still (albeit with a few upgrades)

  I started writing Python and Perl when I was 15 to administer my VMWare ESXi cluster and perform routine tasks. I am by no means only a software guy, and am very interested in the intersection of hardware and software. I currently mostly write code for these practical purposes, and have attained some stunning results with them
  
  A few things I do with my knowlege of both hardware and software is useful devices in and around my house. Examples of these are 
  * A private cloud based on Owncloud
  * storage backend based on ZFS and a cool project called Greyhole
  * A Plex Media server running on top of it all
  * A rasperry pi embedded in areas above my ceiling which monitor and control aspects of my house, using IR distance rangers and a coule of relays, and a whole lotta logic to detect which people in my family are in which rooms, have their music follwo them around from room to room, and have their own presets.
  * A VMWare ESXi cluster based on old server hardware runs all of this (BTW if you need large amounts of compute, the Dell c6100 is *awesome*


  My passion is not only limited to hardware, and I'm currently activley following Ghost, a node.js based blogging platform, and trying to teach myself a lot about node and Jquery. Django really inerests me as s web framework due to its python roots, but i know you guys arent into framewors, so I won't really go into that.
  
  if you need any info about me, feel free to ask!
